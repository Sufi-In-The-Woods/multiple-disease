    ### 🩺 **About EarlyMed**
    EarlyMed is a platform designed by a team of VIT-AP University to help you understand your medical test results before visiting a doctor. 
    If you've recently undergone medical tests at a pathology lab but haven't had the chance to consult a doctor yet, 
    this tool can provide you with preliminary insights into your health.

    ### 🎯 **What will we do in this Test Report Interpreter?**
   If you've been diagnosed with any of the following diseases and have received your lab test report but haven't had the chance to consult a doctor yet, we're here to help. Currently, we support three diseases, but more disorders will be added soon!
    1. **Diabetes**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on factors like glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI.
    2. **Heart Disease**: Assesses the risk of heart disease using parameters like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and ECG results.
    3. **Parkinson's Disease**: Evaluates the possibility of Parkinson's disease using voice analysis and other biomarkers.

    ### 🧪 **How to Use EarlyMed**
    To get started, you'll need the results of certain medical tests. If you haven't undergone these tests yet, 
    we recommend visiting a nearby diagnostic center or pathology lab. Here are some common tests you might need:

    #### Common Tests and Their Purposes:
    - **Lipid Profile**: Measures cholesterol levels (e.g., LDL, HDL, triglycerides) to assess heart health.
    - **Blood Sugar Test**: Measures glucose levels to check for diabetes or prediabetes.
    - **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**: Records the electrical activity of the heart to detect heart disease.
    - **Voice Analysis**: Used for Parkinson's disease diagnosis by analyzing vocal patterns.
    - **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: Provides an overview of your overall health and detects various disorders.

    These values are typically included in standard medical reports. If you already have your test results, 
    you can proceed to the respective disease prediction section from the sidebar.

    ### ⚠️ **Important Note**
    EarlyMed is not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider 
    for a comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan.
